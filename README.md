# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to test and increase the number of users who "convert", meaning the number of users who decide to pay for their products and services. The goal of this project is to help the company decide whether they should implement the new web page, keep the old page or run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Project Tasks

- Probability
- A/B Test - interpret the test statistic and p-value
- Regression - analyze interaction effects on all of p-value and statistical significance to predict conversions
- Conclusion - include both statistical reasoning and practical reasoning for the situation
